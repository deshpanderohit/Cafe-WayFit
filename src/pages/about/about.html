                <p style="font-size: 13px;" padding>
                  Derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, Yoga means union of the individual consciousness or soul with the Universal Consciousness or Spirit. Yoga is a 5000-year-old. Though many a times, yoga is mistaken for just a physical practice but it is not just like any other type of exercise.. Yoga is mental, physical and spiritual. It provides powerful benefits for your health and fitness at same time it also offers harmony, balance and peace for the mind and the soul.

                <p style="font-size: 13px;" padding>
                  Power Yoga is a customizable yoga style influenced by aerobic exercise. Due to its up tempo and brisk nature, power yoga is essentially like an aerobic workout, where yoga poses are done faster and in continuation. Power Yoga is a great way to combine the mental, physical, and spiritual benefits of yoga with high intensity, calorie-burning exercise. Power Yoga strengthens your body, increases flexibility, and promotes stamina and weight loss as well as improving posture and balance.

                <p style="font-size: 13px;" padding>
                  A Zumba class is like any other instructor-led workout, but with simple dance moves heavy on the hips and step counts. Those moves add up to a decent sweat, says John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. He and his colleagues analyzed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a 40-minute class burns about 370 calories, a little more than nine calories per minute.  Zumba classes are specially designed for weight loss, toning and sculpting the body with a trainer led group dance workout.
